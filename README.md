ML-Based Target Detection in SAR Images

#Dataset Description

This dataset is a subset of the MSTAR Clutter dataset and includes 300 training images and 50 testing images. The images were collected using an X-band sensor with a resolution of one foot in spotlight mode.

The data contains clutters of both rural and urban types and features five different types of targets including:

BTR-60 (armored vehicle)
BRDM-2 (fighting vehicle)
ZSU-23/4 (tank)
T62 (tank)
SLICY (multiple simple geometrically shaped static targets)
The pictures were taken at a 15-degree depression angle. This dataset can be used for research and development in target recognition and classification.
